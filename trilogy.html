                            These bookcover designs are inspired by David's natural ability to see the shiny flip-side
                            of any situation.
                            The aim with these illustrations is to encourage readers to <i>shift&nbsp; perspective</i>.

                    <p>David Sedaris is on an overnight flight from New York to Paris with a seat in first-class, aka
                        Business Elite.
                        A seemingly pleasant and confortable flight soon turns a bit unsettling when a grieving Polish
                        man sits next to him.
                        This triggers David into a rollercoaster of intrusive thoughts and recollection. Snapping back
                        to reality in Business Elite,
                        David is humbled by witnessing all forms of life in a mere&nbsp; airplane. </p>

                    <p>At the start of Corona Virus pandemic- hoarding seems to come as second nature for most, except
                        David Sedaris. Recalling the oil crisis in 1973,
                        David was inspired by his father's <i>"professional shopping"</i> abilities and wanted to do the
                        same this time around. After each grocery trip, David comes home with just a handful of random
                        items. </p>

                    <p>In a more serious tone passage- David reflects about life and time. He is in town and visits his
                        father in his retirement home after he had a few health episodes.
                        It was the time of the year when baby loddgerheads hatch. Coincidentally, the very last lone
                        loggerhead to hatch was named "Lou" just like David's&nbsp; father.</p>
