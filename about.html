        <h3>Hi there, thanks for stopping by!</h3>
        <p class="p-center">
            My passion for art from a young age later evolved to a passion for graphic design. During my teen years I
            would easily spend hours behind the computer screen editing Myspace profiles for my family and friends. It
            was
            my first experience with HTML. Just being able to transform text with a "foreign alien language" intrigued
            me and I would be lost in just the simplest HTML. Graphic Design stuck with me all throughout my highschool
            years. A "chill" class soon became <i>my escape,</i> plus I got to make stickers. Upon recieving my high
            school diploma, I also recieved a certicicate for completing the Graphic Design Technology Program at my
            high school. Life's rollercoaster went full force and circled me back to my passion. I am now an Interface
            Design Student in the New Media Arts Program at Kapiolani Community College. If im going to be riding a
            rollercoaster, it might as well be a rollercoaster I enjoy and love.
